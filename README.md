## Player Guide
Enter the number of letters in the word you want to guess.
The game will generate a random word with that length.
You have to take turns guessing words of the same length.
After each guess, you will be informed of the number of 'Black' and 'White' letters in the guessed word. Here
* Black letters indicate letters that are present in the target word but at some place other than they appear in the guessed word.
* White letters indicate letters that are present in the target word at the same place as they appear in the guessed word.

Crack the word within 10 guesses and you win the game. 
There's also a 60 seconds timer for each guess to increase the difficulty.
